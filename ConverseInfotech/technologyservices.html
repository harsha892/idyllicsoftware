                                            Testing has taken a paradigm shift from being an end-of-lifecycle activity to managing user experience in the digital landscape. The core of this is the ability to change faster by adopting newer methodologies and delivering higher quality. Cloud, mobile, social, and big data have been the driving technologies behind digital transformation at most companies worldwide. In addition, digital initiatives are driving higher spend on quality. We believe testing services worldwide will reach US$40 billion by the year 2020, with increased spend on transformation initiatives.

                                        <p>As digital transformation gains momentum, the need for speed-to-market is felt severely by both business and IT. To achieve that pace and flexibility, organizations are adopting agile methods and DevOps principles. In addition, there is an emerging need to have testing teams shift-left and be well-integrated with development teams to ensure that enterprise agility is demonstrated in every aspect.</p>
                                        <br>
                                        <p>In all of these changes, there is a strong need to combine the duality of independent and integrated testing. While we see the need for independent testing, it is imperative for us to be integrated with development teams to drive higher order efficiencies. It is also apparent that both of these are complementary and not mutually exclusive making it necessary for QA organizations to bring in the best of both paradigms.</p>

                                        <p>To offer the dual advantage of a team, which can integrate and work effectively with development teams without losing the independence that we offered so far, we are transforming to become the best QA partner, bringing innovation and business value in everything we do.</p>
