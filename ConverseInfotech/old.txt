                                        Converse Infotech Solutions information systems is rooted in an academic partnership that began in the 2010, Converse Infotech Solutions introduced a new sales force effectiveness and productivity framework. This framework – and future versions – has since been leveraged extensively by the firm to help clients determine their key issues and improve their business performance. The company also began to develop data warehouses for clients, as well as a range of analytical services. These projects were the genesis for Converse Infotech Solutions’s services in client capability building and outsourcing.
